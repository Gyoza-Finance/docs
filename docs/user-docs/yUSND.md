yUSND stands for Yearn-USND, and is the primary liquid yield bearing version of USND.

Deposit USND into the yUSND vault directly on the earn page here: https://app.nerite.org/earn/yusnd

Hold yUSND in your wallet to earn yield from the Nerite stability pools, while Yearn optimizes and balances USND deposits across the pools to maximize yield.

The yUSND vault has no lockup period, and yUSND can be redeemed for the underlying USND at any time.

## yUSND Strategies & Integrations
