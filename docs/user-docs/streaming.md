# Streaming
Nerite has the [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/) protocol built into it, so USND is a native "Super Token" that support streaming. That means you can make real time payments, where USND is sent linearly over time. You can send $0.000001 per second for two weeks, $5 per month for a year, $100 per hour indefinitely... It's completely up to you.

## Create a Stream
Our full UI for this is under development. Check out the Superfluid site to access this feature now. 

## Receiving a Stream
You do not have to do anything to accept a stream, and your wallet balance will increase in real time when someone streams to you. No special wallets or anything else needed, as USND is a normal ERC-20 token. 

Streams are not dependent on block times or the L2 sequencer.

## Example Use Cases:
- Annuities that pay out yield earned on a position linearly forever.
- Onchain subscriptions. Example: stream $25 per month linearly over the course of the month, and cancel at any point to access content or services while the stream is live.
- Milestone based grants. Instead of giving full grant amounts up front, stream the amount of a period of time while milestones are expected to be reached.
- Loans which pay themselves off by streaming yield from a yield-bearing collateral to pay down debt. 

Are you building one of these? Let our team know, we want to support you!
